# Store Hours Management

## Overview

The website automatically displays your current store status (Open, Closed, Closing Soon, etc.) by reading from the `store-hours.json` file. You can easily update your hours without touching any code!

## How to Update Store Hours

1. Open the `store-hours.json` file
2. Edit the times in 24-hour format (e.g., "09:00" for 9 AM, "19:00" for 7 PM)
3. Save the file
4. The website will automatically show the new hours

## JSON File Structure

### Regular Hours
```json
"tuesday": {
  "isOpen": true,
  "openTime": "09:00",
  "closeTime": "19:00"
}
```

- `isOpen`: Set to `false` if closed all day
- `openTime`: Opening time in 24-hour format

## Tips

- Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format
- The system updates every minute automatically
- Make sure to test your changes by checking the website

## Example: Changing Tuesday Hours

To change Tuesday from 9 AM - 7 PM to 10 AM - 8 PM:

**Before:**
```json
"tuesday": {
  "isOpen": true,
  "openTime": "09:00", 
  "closeTime": "19:00"
}
```

**After:**
```json
"tuesday": {
  "isOpen": true,

That's it! The website will automatically update.
